# Apprenticeship
A repository for my work-projects

Currently there are following Programs uploaded:
a Program that uses the Newton-Approximation to find Roots of an polynomial (Subprogram),
a Program that uses the Hornerscheme to make an easy Polynomial divison (Subprogram),
and finally a Program to combine Both and as an Console output (Mainprogram)

a Program that read a user-input and generate a random array, saving the array to a file, reading the array 
out of the file and compare following sorting algorithms: Bubble-Sort
                                                          Quick-Sort,
                                                          Merge-Sort,
                                                          and a Custom Sorting-Algorithm
and Plotting the results with Horizontal Bar Graphs.

a Program with a GUI that calculate the Current and Voltage of Resistors in a Network.
