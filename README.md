# Apprenticeship
A repository for my work-projects

Currently there are following Programs uploaded:
a Program that uses the Newton-Approximation to find Roots of an polynomial,
a Program that uses the Hornerscheme to make an easy Polynomial divison,
and finally a Program to combine Both and as an Console output
